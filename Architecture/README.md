# High Availability 
  Ability of a system or an application to remain operational and accessible even in case of resource failures
 
# How to achieve Highavailibity?
  - Implementing redundancy 
  - Elementing single point of failure
  - Rapid failover to backup resources in case of disruptions

# High Availability within Azure Regions
  
  - Availibity zones (Implementing redundancy)

    Azure regions are divided into multiple Availability Zones, each having independent power 
    and networking infrastructure.

    Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones within a region ensures 
    redundancy and fault tolerance.

    Distributing virtual machines, storage, and other services across different zones, organizations can 
    protect their applications from localized failures and ensure business continuity.

- Load Balancing (Elementing single point of failure)

    Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines or services to improve 
    scalability and availability. 

    By leveraging Load Balancer, organizations can eliminate single points of failure and ensure that their 
    applications can handle traffic spikes while maintaining high availability. 
    
    Load Balancer can be configured to distribute traffic to resources deployed across Availability Zones for 
    additional resilience.

- Azure App Service Environments (ASE)

    For organizations running web applications, Azure App Service Environments (ASE) offer a highly available and 
    scalable platform. 
    
    ASE provides a dedicated and isolated environment with support for automatic scaling, load balancing,   
    and traffic distribution across multiple instances. 
    
    By deploying web applications in ASE, organizations can achieve high availability, even during peak loads 
    or resource failures.

# High Availability across Azure Regions
  - Azure Traffic Manager:

    Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple 
    endpoints in different Azure regions. 

    By configuring Traffic Manager with endpoint monitoring and health checks, organizations can route traffic to the most 
    available region, ensuring high availability and minimizing the impact of regional failures.

  - Azure Front Door

    Azure Front Door is a global load-balancing solution that optimizes and secures web applications at a global scale.     
    It routes incoming traffic to the nearest Azure region with the best performance and availability. 
    
    By leveraging Front Door, organizations can achieve high availability across regions, reduce latency, and provide a 
    consistent user experience, regardless of the userâ€™s location.

  - Azure Site Recovery (ASR)

    Azure Site Recovery is a disaster recovery solution that enables replication and failover of virtual 
    machines and services between Azure regions. 
    
    By implementing ASR, organizations can achieve business continuity by replicating critical workloads to a secondary 
    region and enabling rapid failover in the event of a regional outage. 
    
    ASR also provides automated recovery plans and testing capabilities to validate the resiliency of the solution.

# Best Practices for High Availability Architecture:

  - Design for fault tolerance: 
    Utilize redundant resources and architectures to eliminate single points of failure and improve resilience.

  - Implement automated monitoring and alerting: 
    Continuously monitor the health of resources and set up alerts to proactively respond to any issues.

  - Regularly test failover and disaster recovery processes: 
    Conduct periodic testing to validate the effectiveness of failover mechanisms and ensure  proper recovery.

  - Use Azure Availability Sets: 
    Deploy virtual machines into Availability Sets to ensure that they are spread across different fault domains 
    and update domains for maximum availability.

  - Leverage Azure managed services: 
    Utilize fully managed services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Functions, which are designed 
    with  built-in redundancy and high availability.
