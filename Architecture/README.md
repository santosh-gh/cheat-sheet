# How to achieve Highavailibity?
  - Implementing redundancy 
  - Elementing single point of failure
  - Rapid failover to backup resources in case of disruptions

# High Availability within Azure Regions
  
  - Availibity zones (Implementing redundancy)

    Azure regions are divided into multiple Availability Zones, each having independent power 
    and networking infrastructure.

    Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones within a region ensures 
    redundancy and fault tolerance.

    Distributing virtual machines, storage, and other services across different zones, organizations can 
    protect their applications from localized failures and ensure business continuity.

- Load Balancing (Elementing single point of failure)

    Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines or services to improve 
    scalability and availability. 

    By leveraging Load Balancer, organizations can eliminate single points of failure and ensure that their 
    applications can handle traffic spikes while maintaining high availability. 
    
    Load Balancer can be configured to distribute traffic to resources deployed across Availability Zones for 
    additional resilience.

- Azure App Service Environments (ASE)

    For organizations running web applications, Azure App Service Environments (ASE) offer a highly available and 
    scalable platform. 
    
    ASE provides a dedicated and isolated environment with support for automatic scaling, load balancing,   
    and traffic distribution across multiple instances. 
    
    By deploying web applications in ASE, organizations can achieve high availability, even during peak loads 
    or resource failures.

# Database High Availability and Disaster Recovery

  Ensuring high availability and implementing effective disaster recovery strategies are critical for organizations 
  to minimize downtime, maintain business continuity, and protect against data loss. Azure SQL Database offers a range 
  of features and capabilities to ensure high availability and enable efficient disaster recovery. Let’s explore the 
  key aspects of Azure SQL Database’s high availability and disaster recovery capabilities:

  - Automatic Backups: 
    Azure SQL Database automatically performs regular backups of databases, eliminating the need for manual backup processes. 
    These    backups capture the complete state of the database, including data, schema, and configurations. The backups are 
    stored in Azure Blob Storage, providing redundancy and durability. Organizations can leverage these backups to restore 
    the database to a specific point in time or recover from accidental data loss or corruption.

  - Point-in-Time Restore: 
    Azure SQL Database supports point-in-time restore, allowing organizations to recover their databases to a specific point 
    in time within the retention period. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where data corruption or human errors 
    need to be resolved by restoring the database to a previous consistent state. By leveraging point-in-time restore, 
    organizations can minimize data loss and quickly recover from unintended changes.

  - Geo-Replication: 
    Azure SQL Database offers built-in geo-replication capabilities to enable efficient disaster recovery. Organizations 
    can configure geo-replication to replicate their databases asynchronously to a secondary region, providing a standby 
    database in case of a regional outage or disaster. The secondary database remains synchronized with the primary database, 
    ensuring data consistency. In the event of a failure in the primary region, failover can be initiated to promote the
    secondary database as the new primary, minimizing downtime and enabling seamless application continuity.

    To improve the high availability, A SQL Server failover group has created for the two SQL servers running on 
    those two regions. Azure SQL failover group makes sure that your database up and running all the time even 
    though the primary database becomes unavailable due to an outage of the primary region. When your database 
    of the primary region running without an issue, the primary region’s database works in read-write mode and 
    your secondary region’s database works in read-only mode. All the database updates that you make to the primary 
    database will replicate to the secondary region’s database asynchronously. However, If your primary 
    region’s(Southeast Asia) database becomes unavailable, failover will trigger and the database of the secondary 
    region(East Asia) will become the primary database and will work in read-write mode. When the failed region is 
    restored and back online, the database in East Asia is immediately synchronized with the database in Southeast 
    Asia region, and the read-only listener is switched back to the secondary database in East Asia. During 
    synchronization performance of the primary could be slightly impacted depending on the amount of data that 
    needs to be synchronized. To achieve this, no changes are required in your application source code.

  - Multiple Redundancy Options: 
    Azure SQL Database provides multiple redundancy options to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. These options 
    include zone-redundant, geo-redundant, and read-scale replicas. Zone-redundant replicas distribute database copies across 
    multiple availability zones within a region, offering resiliency against hardware or infrastructure failures. Geo-redundant 
    replicas replicate databases to a secondary region, providing additional protection against regional outages. Read-scale 
    replicas allow organizations to offload read workloads from the primary database, improving performance and scalability 
    while ensuring availability.

  - Service Level Agreements (SLAs): 
    Azure SQL Database offers industry-leading SLAs for high availability. The SLA guarantees a high percentage of uptime and 
    availability for databases. Depending on the deployment option and redundancy choice, Azure SQL Database provides SLAs for 
    both single and pooled databases, ensuring that organizations can rely on consistent performance and availability for their 
    critical applications and data.

  - Monitoring and Alerting: 
    Azure SQL Database integrates seamlessly with Azure Monitor, providing comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and diagnostics 
    capabilities. Organizations can set up alerts to proactively monitor database health, performance metrics, and replication 
    status. By leveraging these insights, organizations can promptly identify and address any issues that may impact availability 
    or disaster recovery.
